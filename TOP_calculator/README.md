## 🧮 TOP Calculator App
[!DesignPreview](./designPrev.png)
# 📝 Project Overview

This is a fully functional, browser-based Basic Calculator application, completed as a core project within The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

The primary objective was to implement complex calculation logic from scratch using pure JavaScript, focusing on:

1. Handling sequential arithmetic operations.

2. Managing the state of the calculator display and memory.

3. Ensuring a clean, responsive UI with full keyboard support.

# 🚀 Live Demo

# ✨ Key Features Implemented

- **Core Arithmetic:** Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

- **Sequential Operations:** Correctly handles continuous calculations without relying on the eval() function (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2 logic is managed manually).

- **Display Management:** Limits display size and handles decimal precision.

- **Input Controls:** Dedicated functions for Clear (C), Delete/Backspace (←), and calculating the Result (=).

- **Full Keyboard Support:** Seamlessly allows users to input numbers, operations, and control commands using their physical keyboard.

- **Error Handling:** Includes a mechanism to prevent and report division by zero errors.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5 :** Semantic structure and calculator grid layout.

- **CSS3 :** Styling, responsiveness, and visual design.

- **Vanilla JavaScript :** All core logic, DOM manipulation, and calculation algorithms.
